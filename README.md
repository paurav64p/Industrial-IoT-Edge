# Advanced IoT Edge Device for Industrial Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project is an IoT-based edge computing device designed for industrial monitoring. It collects real-time sensor data, processes it locally, and transmits key insights to the cloud for analytics. 

## Features
- Edge computing for real-time data processing
- Multi-sensor integration for temperature, humidity, air quality, and vibration monitoring
- Wireless communication using MQTT, LoRaWAN, or Wi-Fi
- Optimized for low power consumption
- Secure data transmission with encryption support
- Cloud dashboard compatibility with AWS IoT, Azure IoT, or ThingsBoard

## Hardware Components
- ESP32 or STM32 microcontroller for edge processing
- DHT11 or DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring
- MQ-135 sensor for air quality measurement
- MPU6050 sensor for vibration detection
- LoRa or Wi-Fi module for wireless data transfer
- OLED display for real-time data visualization (optional)
- Power supply module

## Communication Protocols
- MQTT, HTTP, or WebSockets for cloud communication
- I2C, SPI, or UART for sensor interfacing
- LoRa, Wi-Fi, or BLE for wireless connectivity
